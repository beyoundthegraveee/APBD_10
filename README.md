This repository demonstrates the Code-First approach for creating and managing a database using Entity Framework Core and migrations. 
The project showcases how to define database models directly in code, manage schema changes efficiently, and interact with relational databases.

Features
Code-First Approach:

Database schema is created and managed based on C# classes and relationships.
No need for a pre-existing database schemaâ€”everything is defined in code.
Migrations:

Seamlessly apply and manage database schema changes without manual SQL scripts.
Keep track of database versions and ensure smooth updates.
Entity Framework Core Integration:

Simplifies database interactions (CRUD operations) with LINQ and EF Core features.
Relational Database Support:

Compatible with SQL Server and other relational database systems.

Tech Stack
Language: C#
Framework: .NET Core with Entity Framework Core
